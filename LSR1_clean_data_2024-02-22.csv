However, its effect on chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced depression phenotypes and the underlying mechanism remain unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether CPT could exert an antidepressant effect. Methods We investigated the effects of CPT in a CUSinduced depression model and explored whether these effects were related to the anti-inflammatory and neurogenesis promoting properties by investigating the expression levels of various signaling molecules at the mRNA and protein levels. Results Administration of CPT improved depression like behaviors in CUS-induced mice. CPT administration increased the levels of doublecortin-positive cells and reversed the decrease in the expression levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB) signaling transduction, as well as the downstream functional proteins, phosphorylated extracellular regulated protein kinases (p-ERK), and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-response element-binding protein levels (pCREB) in hippocampus. CPT treatment also inhibited the activation of microglia and suppressed M1 microglial polarization, while promoting M2 microglial polarization by monitoring the expression levels of arginase 1 (Arg-1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and further inhibited the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1, IL 6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and increased the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 by regulating nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB) activation.

Conclusions CPT relieves the depressive-like state in CUS-induced mice by enhancing neurogenesis and inhibiting inflammation through the BDNF/TrkB and NF-KB pathways and could therefore serve as a promising candidate for the treatment of depression.",NA,"Binzhou Med Univ Hosp, Dept Psychol, 661 Huanghe 2nd Rd, Binzhou 256603, Shandong, Peoples R China and Binzhou Med Univ Hosp, Dept Neurol, 661 Huanghe 2nd Rd, Binzhou 256603, Shandong, Peoples R China and Binzhou Med Univ Hosp, Med Res Ctr, Binzhou, Shandong, Peoples R China and Binzhou Med Univ Hosp, Inst Metab & Neuropsychiat Disorders, Binzhou, Shandong, Peoples R China and Jinan Hosp, Dept Internal Med, Jinan, Shandong, Peoples R China and Binzhou Med Univ Hosp, Dept Gastroenterol, Binzhou, Shandong, Peoples R China","2021","10.1515/tnsci-2020-0198","JOUR","cryptotanshinone and depression and neuroinflam-mation and microglial polarization and neurogenesis and BDNF and NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR and EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS and BDNF and BRAIN and PROMOTERS and NEURONS and NEUROGENESIS and INFLAMMATION and ACTIVATION and EXPRESSION",NA,"WOS:000725194200001",2023-10-10 14:14:08,"4f0df68a-cad3-4a3a-8c46-91f93b86e91f","screening_decisions_GALENOSLSR1project",FALSE,"3eed8e8f-ea6f-48ba-a768-a5578c431862","Francesca Tinsdeall","Animal","Complete randomisation",FALSE,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Vehicle",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Sucrose/saccharin intake or preference test",NA,"Minutes","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Interval",FALSE,"Male","WT","Mouse","C57BL/6 (mouse)","Exact number",8,8,NA,NA,NA,"Weeks","At recruitment to study",NA,NA,20,25,"Grams (g)","Yes",2023-12-19 11:01:57,"c54c3e5f-52e7-4afd-aa0a-4a9bb08b4e24","sucrose preference","sucrose preference","Sucrose preference test","0908f37c-5dc4-4fe1-87e2-bc39f3b2d205","7f305452-51e2-4164-81ad-90a4976094d9",8,TRUE,NA,NA,TRUE,NA,NA,"True",NA,"0ce6c21a-c69f-4878-a261-832dbba157d4",NA,"Sham","vehicle","Negative control",NA,FALSE,0,80.2,"Mean","%",4.1,"SEM",NA,"e3a49205-7b42-46ff-bc13-4b34597d7e94.c54c3e5f-52e7-4afd-aa0a-4a9bb08b4e24.0908f37c-5dc4-4fe1-87e2-bc39f3b2d205.0",NA,"S",NA,NA,"NA, NA NA","NA, NA NA",NA,NA,"cryptotanshinone, 20 mg/kg","TvC","Sucrose/saccharin intake or preference test",14,"Days","944169ce-3245-4579-83e2-857756232753","CMS: vehicle",8,63.1,5.2,14.7078210486802,"CMS: CPT",8,77.2,3.3,9.33380951166243,"control: vehicle",8,80.2,4.1,11.5965512114594,TRUE,1.08208584514639,0.286590930508318,82.4561403508772,-86.0106494074865,-54.583681354751,36.0159861758195,"mg/kg",NA,2,"Between 1-4 weeks","Prophylactic","Mouse","C57BL/6 (mouse)","Male","cryptotanshinone","Other (enter in comments)","20","Sucrose preference test",0,"0 criteria met","No low RoB items",13,"D: 12-15 criteria met","Behavioural: CUMS",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Effect of haloperidol (HAL) and aripiprazole (ARI) on chronic mild stress (CMS) induced neurobehavioral and CRH/CRHR1 system changes was studied in functionally interconnected rat brain areas including prefrontal cortex (PFC), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), hippocampus (HIP), and amygdala (AMY). Animals were exposed to CMS for 3-weeks and since the 7th day of CMS injected with vehicle (VEH), HAL (1Â mg/kg) or ARI (10Â mg/kg) for 4-weeks. Expression levels of CRH, CRHR1, and c-fos genes and anxiety-like and anhedonia behavioural patterns were evaluated. CMS in VEH animals suppressed CRH gene expression in the PFC and BNST, c-fos expression in all areas, except HIP, and increased CRHR1 gene expression in the HIP. Antipsychotics decreased CRH gene expression in all areas, except HIP and by CMS elevated CRHR1 expression in the HIP (ARI also in AMY). CMS and antipsychotics decreased the sucrose preference.

OBJECTIVE: The present studies assessed potential sex differences in rodent paradigms used to study different components of depressive-like behavior, and in the treatment response to antidepressants with different mechanisms of action. METHODS: Male and female CD1 mice received Tetrabenazine (TBZ), a VMAT-2 blocker that depletes DA and induces depressive symptoms in humans. Mice were tested on the Forced Swim Test, (FST), the Dark-Light box (DL), the elevated plus maze (EPM), Social Interaction (SI) test, and sucrose preference and consumption using the two bottles test. In addition, bupropion (a DA reuptake inhibitor) or fluoxetine (a serotonin reuptake inhibitor) were used to reverse TBZ-induced anergia. RESULTS: In the FST, bupropion reversed TBZ effects in both sexes but fluoxetine was only effective in female mice. DA depletion did not affect other aspects of depression such as anxiety, sociability or sucrose consumption, and there was no interaction with bupropion on these parameters. In TBZ treated-females SERT-blockers may be effective at reversing anergia in aversive contexts (FST), and potentiating avoidance of anxiogenic stimuli.

Recently, we identified its extracting components and looked for the potentials in treatment for depression by improving the function of monoamine neurotransmitters. AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists.

Recently, we identified its extracting components and looked for the potentials in treatment for depression by improving the function of monoamine neurotransmitters. AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

Recently, we identified its extracting components and looked for the potentials in treatment for depression by improving the function of monoamine neurotransmitters. AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

Recently, we identified its extracting components and looked for the potentials in treatment for depression by improving the function of monoamine neurotransmitters. AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4.

AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4.

After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids.

AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

The role of D2Rs in chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced depression-like behaviors is not clear. Quinpirole (a D2R agonist) and eticlopride (a D2R antagonist) were stereotactically delivered into the NAc before Sprague Dawley rats underwent CUS. CUS-induced depression-like behaviors were accompanied by a significant decrease in both the dopamine (DA) level and D2R expression in the NAc. Eticlopride reversed CUS-induced depression-like behavior and rescued the DA levels in the NAc, and microinjection of DA into the NAc of CUS individuals had the same effect as eticlopride. By contrast, delivery of quinpirole into the NAc of control animals induced depression-like behaviors accompanied by a decrease in the DA level in the NAc. These results show that DA plays a key role in CUS-induced depression-like behaviors and the D2R exerts a presynaptic negative feedback on DA levels during CUS. Microinjection of quinpirole into the NAc also decreased the level of the kalirin-7 protein in the NAc of both control and stressed animals, while eticlopride increased its level in the NAc of rats. In agreement with these results, intraperitoneal injection of eticlopride in mice also caused an increase in both the kalirin-7 protein level in the NAc and spine density in MSNs, while quinpirole reduced them. These results suggest that regulation of kalirin-7 through D2R in the NAc is a general pathway in rats and mice, and is involved in CUS-induced depression-like behaviors. Kalirin-7 may be directly regulated through the D2R postsynaptic pathway or indirectly through the presynaptic pathway in the NAc. The interaction between D2R and kalirin-7 needs to be investigated further.

Therefore, main objectives of the present study were to evaluate the effect of maternal chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) on behavioural changes, levels of oxidative stress, changes in selective developmental signaling genes and neurogenesis in the adult brain of Wistar rats and its reversal through a selective non-ergoline D2 type dopamine receptor (D2R) agonist Ropinirole (ROPI). Effects of ROPI treatment on CUMS induced adult rats offspring were measured by assessment of behavioural tests (sucrose preference test and forced swim test), biomarkers of oxidative stress, protein expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), mRNA expression of SHH, GSK-3Î², Î²-catenin, Notch, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), Dopamine receptor 2 (Drd2) and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) cell proliferation assay. The oxidative stress, protein and mRNA expression were determined in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex while the BrdU cell proliferation was observed in the hippocampus of rat brain. PNS induced changes resulted in depression validated by the depression-like behaviours, increased oxidative stress, decreased TH expression, altered expression of selective developmental genes, along with the reduced hippocampal neurogenesis and BDNF expression in the brain of adult offsprings.

Previous reports showed that SKF83959 elicited antidepressant activity in the forced swim test and tail suspension test as a novel triple reuptake inhibitor. However, there are no studies showing the effects of SKF83959 in a chronic stress model of depression and the role of phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±/brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway in SKF83959-mediated antidepressant effects. METHODS: In this study, SKF83959 was firstly investigated in the chronic social defeat stress model of depression. The changes in hippocampal neurogenesis, dendrite spine density, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway after chronic social defeat stress and SKF83959 treatment were then investigated. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA/short hairpin RNA methods were further used to explore the antidepressive mechanisms of SKF83959. RESULTS: We found that SKF83959 produced antidepressant effects in the chronic social defeat stress model and also restored the chronic social defeat stress-induced decrease in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway, dendritic spine density, and neurogenesis. By using various inhibitors and siRNA/shRNA methods, we further demonstrated that the hippocampal dopamine D5 receptor, phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/ calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ± pathway, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor system are all necessary for the SKF83959 effects. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SKF83959 can be developed as a novel antidepressant and produces antidepressant effects via the hippocampal D5/ phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±/brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway.",NA,"Department of Pharmacology, School of Basic Medicine, Tongji Medical College, and Huazhong University of Science and

phospholipase CÎ²/inositol phosphate 3 pathway, resulting in the activation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±, which affects the synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a neurotrophic factor critical for the pathophysiology of depression. Previous reports showed that SKF83959 elicited antidepressant activity in the forced swim test and tail suspension test as a novel triple reuptake inhibitor. However, there are no studies showing the effects of SKF83959 in a chronic stress model of depression and the role of phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±/brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway in SKF83959-mediated antidepressant effects. METHODS: In this study, SKF83959 was firstly investigated in the chronic social defeat stress model of depression. The changes in hippocampal neurogenesis, dendrite spine density, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway after chronic social defeat stress and SKF83959 treatment were then investigated. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA/short hairpin RNA methods were further used to explore the antidepressive mechanisms of SKF83959. RESULTS: We found that SKF83959 produced antidepressant effects in the chronic social defeat stress model and also restored the chronic social defeat stress-induced decrease in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway, dendritic spine density, and neurogenesis. By using various inhibitors and siRNA/shRNA methods, we further demonstrated that the hippocampal dopamine D5 receptor, phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/ calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ± pathway, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor system are all necessary for the SKF83959 effects. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SKF83959 can be developed as a novel antidepressant and produces antidepressant effects via the hippocampal D5/ phospholipase C/inositol phosphate

phospholipase CÎ²/inositol phosphate 3 pathway, resulting in the activation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±, which affects the synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a neurotrophic factor critical for the pathophysiology of depression. Previous reports showed that SKF83959 elicited antidepressant activity in the forced swim test and tail suspension test as a novel triple reuptake inhibitor. However, there are no studies showing the effects of SKF83959 in a chronic stress model of depression and the role of phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±/brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway in SKF83959-mediated antidepressant effects. METHODS: In this study, SKF83959 was firstly investigated in the chronic social defeat stress model of depression. The changes in hippocampal neurogenesis, dendrite spine density, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway after chronic social defeat stress and SKF83959 treatment were then investigated. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA/short hairpin RNA methods were further used to explore the antidepressive mechanisms of SKF83959. RESULTS: We found that SKF83959 produced antidepressant effects in the chronic social defeat stress model and also restored the chronic social defeat stress-induced decrease in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway, dendritic spine density, and neurogenesis. By using various inhibitors and siRNA/shRNA methods, we further demonstrated that the hippocampal dopamine D5 receptor, phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/ calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ± pathway, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor system are all necessary for the SKF83959 effects. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SKF83959 can be developed as a novel antidepressant and produces antidepressant effects via the hippocampal D5/ phospholipase C/inositol phosphate

phospholipase CÎ²/inositol phosphate 3 pathway, resulting in the activation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±, which affects the synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a neurotrophic factor critical for the pathophysiology of depression. Previous reports showed that SKF83959 elicited antidepressant activity in the forced swim test and tail suspension test as a novel triple reuptake inhibitor. However, there are no studies showing the effects of SKF83959 in a chronic stress model of depression and the role of phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±/brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway in SKF83959-mediated antidepressant effects. METHODS: In this study, SKF83959 was firstly investigated in the chronic social defeat stress model of depression. The changes in hippocampal neurogenesis, dendrite spine density, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway after chronic social defeat stress and SKF83959 treatment were then investigated. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA/short hairpin RNA methods were further used to explore the antidepressive mechanisms of SKF83959. RESULTS: We found that SKF83959 produced antidepressant effects in the chronic social defeat stress model and also restored the chronic social defeat stress-induced decrease in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway, dendritic spine density, and neurogenesis. By using various inhibitors and siRNA/shRNA methods, we further demonstrated that the hippocampal dopamine D5 receptor, phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/ calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ± pathway, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor system are all necessary for the SKF83959 effects. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SKF83959 can be developed as a novel antidepressant and produces antidepressant effects via the hippocampal D5/ phospholipase C/inositol phosphate

phospholipase CÎ²/inositol phosphate 3 pathway, resulting in the activation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±, which affects the synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a neurotrophic factor critical for the pathophysiology of depression. Previous reports showed that SKF83959 elicited antidepressant activity in the forced swim test and tail suspension test as a novel triple reuptake inhibitor. However, there are no studies showing the effects of SKF83959 in a chronic stress model of depression and the role of phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±/brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway in SKF83959-mediated antidepressant effects. METHODS: In this study, SKF83959 was firstly investigated in the chronic social defeat stress model of depression. The changes in hippocampal neurogenesis, dendrite spine density, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway after chronic social defeat stress and SKF83959 treatment were then investigated. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA/short hairpin RNA methods were further used to explore the antidepressive mechanisms of SKF83959. RESULTS: We found that SKF83959 produced antidepressant effects in the chronic social defeat stress model and also restored the chronic social defeat stress-induced decrease in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway, dendritic spine density, and neurogenesis. By using various inhibitors and siRNA/shRNA methods, we further demonstrated that the hippocampal dopamine D5 receptor, phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/ calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ± pathway, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor system are all necessary for the SKF83959 effects. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SKF83959 can be developed as a novel antidepressant and produces antidepressant effects via the hippocampal D5/ phospholipase C/inositol phosphate

phospholipase CÎ²/inositol phosphate 3 pathway, resulting in the activation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±, which affects the synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a neurotrophic factor critical for the pathophysiology of depression. Previous reports showed that SKF83959 elicited antidepressant activity in the forced swim test and tail suspension test as a novel triple reuptake inhibitor. However, there are no studies showing the effects of SKF83959 in a chronic stress model of depression and the role of phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±/brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway in SKF83959-mediated antidepressant effects. METHODS: In this study, SKF83959 was firstly investigated in the chronic social defeat stress model of depression. The changes in hippocampal neurogenesis, dendrite spine density, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway after chronic social defeat stress and SKF83959 treatment were then investigated. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA/short hairpin RNA methods were further used to explore the antidepressive mechanisms of SKF83959. RESULTS: We found that SKF83959 produced antidepressant effects in the chronic social defeat stress model and also restored the chronic social defeat stress-induced decrease in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway, dendritic spine density, and neurogenesis. By using various inhibitors and siRNA/shRNA methods, we further demonstrated that the hippocampal dopamine D5 receptor, phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/ calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ± pathway, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor system are all necessary for the SKF83959 effects. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SKF83959 can be developed as a novel antidepressant and produces antidepressant effects via the hippocampal D5/ phospholipase C/inositol phosphate

phospholipase CÎ²/inositol phosphate 3 pathway, resulting in the activation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±, which affects the synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a neurotrophic factor critical for the pathophysiology of depression. Previous reports showed that SKF83959 elicited antidepressant activity in the forced swim test and tail suspension test as a novel triple reuptake inhibitor. However, there are no studies showing the effects of SKF83959 in a chronic stress model of depression and the role of phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±/brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway in SKF83959-mediated antidepressant effects. METHODS: In this study, SKF83959 was firstly investigated in the chronic social defeat stress model of depression. The changes in hippocampal neurogenesis, dendrite spine density, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway after chronic social defeat stress and SKF83959 treatment were then investigated. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA/short hairpin RNA methods were further used to explore the antidepressive mechanisms of SKF83959. RESULTS: We found that SKF83959 produced antidepressant effects in the chronic social defeat stress model and also restored the chronic social defeat stress-induced decrease in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway, dendritic spine density, and neurogenesis. By using various inhibitors and siRNA/shRNA methods, we further demonstrated that the hippocampal dopamine D5 receptor, phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/ calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ± pathway, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor system are all necessary for the SKF83959 effects. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SKF83959 can be developed as a novel antidepressant and produces antidepressant effects via the hippocampal D5/ phospholipase C/inositol phosphate

Recently, we identified its extracting components and looked for the potentials in treatment for depression by improving the function of monoamine neurotransmitters. AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

It is well accepted that emotional stress in early life, such as maternal separation (MS), leads to alterations in the neurotransmission systems of various brain regions, especially the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, and subsequently can increase the risk for development of psychiatric disorders including depression in adulthood. Selegiline is an irreversible monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B inhibitor which increases striatal dopamine levels and exerts an antidepressant effect. In this study, 180min of MS stress was applied to mice at postnatal day (PND) 2-14 followed by behavioral tests for determining depressive-like behaviors, such as forced swimming test (FST), splash test and sucrose preference test (SPT) in adult mice (PND 50). The open field test (OFT) also was applied to validate FST results. We used SCH23390 (D1 antagonist) and sulpiride (D2 antagonist) in order to determine the role of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in antidepressant-like effects of selegiline. Our results revealed that MS provoked depressive-like behaviors in adult male mice, and the administration of selegiline attenuated depressive-like behaviors in MS mice. Our findings showed that D1 dopamine receptors facilitate the positive effects of selegiline on the passive behavior in the FST. Furthermore, antidepressant effects of selegiline on hedonic difficulties are mediated via D2 receptor in the SPT. The results of the splash test revealed that both D1 and D2 receptors mediate the protective effect of selegiline against motivational and self-care problems. Based on our results, we conclude that both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors are involved in mediating the antidepressant-like effect of selegiline.

It is well accepted that emotional stress in early life, such as maternal separation (MS), leads to alterations in the neurotransmission systems of various brain regions, especially the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, and subsequently can increase the risk for development of psychiatric disorders including depression in adulthood. Selegiline is an irreversible monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B inhibitor which increases striatal dopamine levels and exerts an antidepressant effect. In this study, 180min of MS stress was applied to mice at postnatal day (PND) 2-14 followed by behavioral tests for determining depressive-like behaviors, such as forced swimming test (FST), splash test and sucrose preference test (SPT) in adult mice (PND 50). The open field test (OFT) also was applied to validate FST results. We used SCH23390 (D1 antagonist) and sulpiride (D2 antagonist) in order to determine the role of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in antidepressant-like effects of selegiline. Our results revealed that MS provoked depressive-like behaviors in adult male mice, and the administration of selegiline attenuated depressive-like behaviors in MS mice. Our findings showed that D1 dopamine receptors facilitate the positive effects of selegiline on the passive behavior in the FST. Furthermore, antidepressant effects of selegiline on hedonic difficulties are mediated via D2 receptor in the SPT. The results of the splash test revealed that both D1 and D2 receptors mediate the protective effect of selegiline against motivational and self-care problems. Based on our results, we conclude that both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors are involved in mediating the antidepressant-like effect of selegiline. We found that D1 receptors mediate an effect on despair behavior, D2 receptors mediate an effect on anhedonia, and both D1 and D2 receptors contribute to the protective effects of selegiline on motivational complications.

Here, we determined the neuroimmune effects of different classes of ADs by using the LPS inflammatory model of depression. METHODS: Male rats received amitriptyline (AMI) a tricyclic, S-citalopram (ESC) a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, tranylcypromine (TCP) a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, vortioxetine (VORT) a multimodal AD or saline for ten days. One-hour after the last AD administration, rats were exposed to LPS 0.83Â mg/kg or saline and 24Â h later were tested for depressive-like behavior. Plasma corticosterone, brain levels of nitrite, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, phospho-cAMP Response Element-Binding Protein (CREB) and nuclear factor (NF)-kB p 65 were determined. RESULTS: LPS induced despair-like, impaired motivation/self-care behavior and caused anhedonia. All ADs prevented LPS-induced despair-like behavior, but only VORT rescued impaired self-care behavior. All ADs prevented LPS-induced increase in brain pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1Î² and IL-6] and T-helper 1 cytokines [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± and interferon-Î³]. VORT increased striatal and hypothalamic IL-4 levels. All ADs prevented LPS-induced neuroendocrine alterations represented by increased levels of hypothalamic nitrite and plasma corticosterone response.

The role of mesolimbic dopamine (DA) in regulating behavioral activation has been extensively studied in male rodents, but little is known in female rodents. OBJECTIVE: The present studies assessed potential sex differences in rodent paradigms used to study different components of depressive-like behavior, and in the treatment response to antidepressants with different mechanisms of action. METHODS: Male and female CD1 mice received Tetrabenazine (TBZ), a VMAT-2 blocker that depletes DA and induces depressive symptoms in humans. Mice were tested on the Forced Swim Test, (FST), the Dark-Light box (DL), the elevated plus maze (EPM), Social Interaction (SI) test, and sucrose preference and consumption using the two bottles test. In addition, bupropion (a DA reuptake inhibitor) or fluoxetine (a serotonin reuptake inhibitor) were used to reverse TBZ-induced anergia. RESULTS: In the FST, bupropion reversed TBZ effects in both sexes but fluoxetine was only effective in female mice. DA depletion did not affect other aspects of depression such as anxiety, sociability or sucrose consumption, and there was no interaction with bupropion on these parameters.

Recently, we identified its extracting components and looked for the potentials in treatment for depression by improving the function of monoamine neurotransmitters. AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists.

Recently, we identified its extracting components and looked for the potentials in treatment for depression by improving the function of monoamine neurotransmitters. AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that S4 was a potential inhibitor of MAO reuptake that could rescue depression in a CUMS-model rats by restoring monoamine neurotransmitters in different encephalic regions.",NA,"Guangdong Engineering & Technology Research Center for Quality and Efficacy and Reevaluation of Post-Market Traditional Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of and Biocontrol and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, School of and Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 135 Xingang Xi Road, Guangzhou, 510275, and China: Formula-Pattern Research Center, School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China. and Guangdong Engineering & Technology Research Center for Quality and Efficacy and Reevaluation of Post-Market Traditional Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of and Biocontrol and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, School of and Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 135 Xingang Xi Road, Guangzhou, 510275, and China. and Guangdong Engineering & Technology Research Center for Quality and Efficacy and Reevaluation of Post-Market Traditional Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of and Biocontrol and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, School of and Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 135 Xingang Xi Road, Guangzhou, 510275, and China. and Guangdong Engineering & Technology Research Center for Quality and Efficacy and Reevaluation of Post-Market Traditional Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of and Biocontrol and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, School of and Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 135 Xingang Xi Road, Guangzhou, 510275, and China. and Guangdong Engineering & Technology Research Center for Quality and Efficacy and Reevaluation of Post-Market Traditional Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of and Biocontrol and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, School of and Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 135 Xingang Xi Road, Guangzhou, 510275, and China. and Guangdong Engineering & Technology Research Center for Quality and Efficacy and Reevaluation of Post-Market Traditional Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of and Biocontrol and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, School of and Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 135 Xingang Xi Road, Guangzhou, 510275, and China. and Guangdong Engineering & Technology Research Center for Quality and Efficacy and Reevaluation of Post-Market Traditional Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of and Biocontrol and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, School of and Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 135 Xingang Xi Road, Guangzhou, 510275, and China.

AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4.

After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

Partial D2 receptor agonism is thought to stabilize dopaminergic neurotransmission in the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways. Dysregulation in the dopamine and serotonin systems is known to be one of the factors that is responsible for the etiology of depression. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the antidepressant potential of aripiprazole in rats by studying its effects on dopamine and serotonin receptors. Method: In this study, male Wistar Albino rats of 8-week old were used. They were divided into 4 groups, each of which consisted of 8 rats. As a depression model, the Chronic Mild Stress (CMS) model was used for four weeks on the rats. The first group was the control group and that received saline as a placebo without CMS. For the second group, aripiprazole (2.5 mg/kg) was administered with CMS: for the third group, escitalopram (10 mg/kg) was administered with CMS and for fourth group a placebo (serum physiologic) was given with CMS. Additionally a sucrose consumption test was performed before and after the CMS model. Results: Sucrose intake at the baseline and within the first week of the study did not differ among the groups. The sucrose consumption of the group with CMS was significantly lower than that of the control group during the second, third and fourth weeks. While the consumption of sucrose in the groups who received aripiprazole and escitalopram did not differ from the group which was exposed to CMS at the beginning and during the first and second weeks, it was significantly higher at the third and fourth weeks. The sucrose consumption values of the groups that received aripiprazole and escitalopram were not different from the control group throughout the study.

As it appears to improve mood, we examined its actions in rodent models of antidepressant properties, in comparison with the prototypical anti-Parkinson agent, apomorphine, the D2/D3 receptor agonist, quinpirole, and the antidepressants, imipramine and fluvoxamine. In the mouse forced-swim test, acute administration of imipramine, fluvoxamine, apomorphine or quinpirole decreased immobility time, actions dose dependently mimicked by piribedil (2.5-10.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously). In rats, acute and subchronic administration of piribedil similarly reduced immobility (0.63-10.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) and apomorphine, quinpirole and imipramine were also active in this test, whereas fluvoxamine was inactive. Both in mice and in rats, the D2/D3 receptor antagonist, raclopride, and the D2 receptor antagonist, L741,626, dose dependently blocked the antidepressant properties of piribedil, whereas the selective D3 receptor antagonists, S33084 and SB277,011, were ineffective. In a chronic mild stress model in rats, piribedil (2.5-40.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) restored sucrose intake in stressed animals exerting its actions more rapidly (by week 1) than imipramine. Imipramine, fluvoxamine, apomorphine, quinpirole and piribedil dose dependently (0.63-10.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) suppressed aggressive and marble-burying behaviour in mice. In the latter procedure, raclopride and L741,626, but not S33084, attenuated the actions of piribedil.

In the latter procedure, raclopride and L741,626, but not S33084, attenuated the actions of piribedil. Over a dose range (0.63-10.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) equivalent to those active in models of antidepressant activity, piribedil did not stimulate locomotor behaviour.

In addition, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are still poorly understood. METHODS: We used a mouse model of PSD to examine the neurobiological mechanisms of PSD and the beneficial effects of aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic drug. PSD was induced in mice by combining middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with spatial restraint stress. The body weight, sucrose preference, and forced swim tests were performed at 5, 7, and 9 weeks and the Morris water maze test at 10 weeks after completing MCAO and spatial restraint stress. RESULTS: Mice subjected to MCAO and spatial restraint stress showed significant depressive-like behavior in the sucrose preference test and forced swim test as well as cognitive impairment in the Morris water maze test. The PSD-like phenotype was accompanied by an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) expression increase in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, but not in the striatum. Furthermore, the increased IDO1 levels were localized in Iba-1(+) cells but not in NeuN(+) or GFAP(+) cells, indicating that microglia-induced IDO1 expression was prominent in the PSD mouse brain. Moreover, 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase (HAAO), quinolinic acid (QUIN), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were significantly increased in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus of PSD mice. Importantly, a 2-week aripiprazole (1â€‰mg/kg, per os) regimen, which was initiated 1 day after MCAO, ameliorated depressive-like behavior and impairment of cognitive functions in PSD mice that was accompanied by downregulation of IDO1, HAAO, QUIN, and ROS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the IDO1-dependent neurotoxic kynurenine metabolism induced by microglia functions in PSD pathogenesis. The beneficial effect of aripiprazole on depressive-like behavior and cognitive impairment may be mediated by inhibition of IDO1, HAAO, QUIN, and ROS.",NA,"Department of Korean Medical Science, School

The PSD-like phenotype was accompanied by an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) expression increase in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, but not in the striatum. Furthermore, the increased IDO1 levels were localized in Iba-1(+) cells but not in NeuN(+) or GFAP(+) cells, indicating that microglia-induced IDO1 expression was prominent in the PSD mouse brain. Moreover, 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase (HAAO), quinolinic acid (QUIN), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were significantly increased in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus of PSD mice. Importantly, a 2-week aripiprazole (1â€‰mg/kg, per os) regimen, which was initiated 1 day after MCAO, ameliorated depressive-like behavior and impairment of cognitive functions in PSD mice that was accompanied by downregulation of IDO1, HAAO, QUIN, and ROS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the IDO1-dependent neurotoxic kynurenine metabolism induced by microglia functions in PSD pathogenesis. The beneficial effect of aripiprazole on depressive-like behavior and cognitive impairment may be mediated by inhibition of IDO1, HAAO, QUIN, and ROS.",NA,"Department of Korean Medical Science, School

In addition, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are still poorly understood. METHODS: We used a mouse model of PSD to examine the neurobiological mechanisms of PSD and the beneficial effects of aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic drug. PSD was induced in mice by combining middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with spatial restraint stress. The body weight, sucrose preference, and forced swim tests were performed at 5, 7, and 9 weeks and the Morris water maze test at 10 weeks after completing MCAO and spatial restraint stress. RESULTS: Mice subjected to MCAO and spatial restraint stress showed significant depressive-like behavior in the sucrose preference test and forced swim test as well as cognitive impairment in the Morris water maze test. The PSD-like phenotype was accompanied by an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) expression increase in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, but not in the striatum. Furthermore, the increased IDO1 levels were localized in Iba-1(+) cells but not in NeuN(+) or GFAP(+) cells, indicating that microglia-induced IDO1 expression was prominent in the PSD mouse brain. Moreover, 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase (HAAO), quinolinic acid (QUIN), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were significantly increased in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus of PSD mice. Importantly, a 2-week aripiprazole (1â€‰mg/kg, per os) regimen, which was initiated 1 day after MCAO, ameliorated depressive-like behavior and impairment of cognitive functions in PSD mice that was accompanied by downregulation of IDO1, HAAO, QUIN, and ROS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the IDO1-dependent neurotoxic kynurenine metabolism induced by microglia functions in PSD pathogenesis. The beneficial effect of aripiprazole on depressive-like behavior and cognitive impairment may be mediated by inhibition of IDO1, HAAO, QUIN, and ROS.",NA,"Department of Korean Medical Science, School

with Spatial Restraint Stress.","Koo YS and Kim H and Park JH and Kim MJ and Shin YI and Choi BT and Lee SY and Shin HK","Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity",NA,"AIM: Poststroke depression (PSD), which occurs in approximately one-third of stroke survivors, is clinically important because of its association with slow functional recovery and increased mortality. In addition, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are still poorly understood. METHODS: We used a mouse model of PSD to examine the neurobiological mechanisms of PSD and the beneficial effects of aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic drug. PSD was induced in mice by combining middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with spatial restraint stress. The body weight, sucrose preference, and forced swim tests were performed at 5, 7, and 9 weeks and the Morris water maze test at 10 weeks after completing MCAO and spatial restraint stress. RESULTS: Mice subjected to MCAO and spatial restraint stress showed significant depressive-like behavior in the sucrose preference test and forced swim test as well as cognitive impairment in the Morris water maze test. The PSD-like phenotype was accompanied by an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) expression increase in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, but not in the striatum. Furthermore, the increased IDO1 levels were localized in Iba-1(+) cells but not in NeuN(+) or GFAP(+) cells, indicating that microglia-induced IDO1 expression was prominent in the PSD mouse brain. Moreover, 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase (HAAO), quinolinic acid (QUIN), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were significantly increased in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus of PSD mice. Importantly, a 2-week aripiprazole (1â€‰mg/kg, per os) regimen, which was initiated 1 day after MCAO, ameliorated depressive-like behavior and impairment of cognitive functions in PSD mice that was accompanied by downregulation of IDO1, HAAO, QUIN, and ROS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the IDO1-dependent neurotoxic kynurenine metabolism induced by microglia functions in PSD pathogenesis. The beneficial effect of aripiprazole on depressive-like behavior and cognitive impairment may be mediated by inhibition of IDO1, HAAO, QUIN, and ROS.",NA,"Department of Korean Medical Science, School

Mice subjected to CMS were treated with simvastatin (10 mg/kg, per os (orally)) along with bromocriptine (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (ip)), levodopa (200 mg/kg, ip), or haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg, ip) for 14 days. CMS produced a decrease in sucrose intake and an increase in serum cholesterol and triglycerides levels with a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which were prevented by simvastatin. This was greater when it was combined with bromocriptine or levodopa. Haloperidol significantly prevented the simvastatin-induced increase in sucrose intake but not the alterations in lipids. There was an upregulation in the expression of BDNF exon-IIA and -IIB transcripts by CMS but not the exon-IIC transcripts. Simvastatin could increase expression of exon-IIC transcripts in stressed mice. This was partially increased by bromocriptine. Haloperidol significantly prevented simvastatin-induced increase in expression of BDNF exon-IIC transcripts.

Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control, control + AMA, stress and stress + AMA groups. The chronic stress model combined chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) with isolated feeding. Animals were exposed to CUS continued for 21 days. AMA (25 mg/kg) was administrated p.o. for 20 days from the 4th day of CUS to the 23rd. Weight and sucrose consumption were measured during model establishing period. Spatial memory was evaluated using the Morris water maze (MWM) test. Following MWM testing, both long-term potentiation (LTP) and depotentiation were recorded in the hippocampal CA1 region. NR2B and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) proteins were measured by Western-blot analysis. AMA increased weight and sucrose consumption of stressed rats. Spatial memory and reversal learning in stressed rats were impaired relative to controls, whereas AMA significantly attenuated cognitive impairment. AMA also mitigated the chronic stress-induced impairment of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, in which both the LTP and depotentiation were significantly inhibited in stressed rats. Moreover, AMA enhanced the expression of hippocampal NR2B and PSD-95 in stressed rats. The data suggest that AMA may be an effective therapeutic agent for depression-like symptoms and associated cognitive disturbances.

Its therapeutic indications were extended to acute manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder. In addition, APZ was approved as an adjunct therapy for major depressive disorder in 2007. Compared to other antipsychotic drugs, APZ has a unique pharmacological profile. It is a partial agonist at D2 dopamine receptors and serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors, whereas it is an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT6 receptors. Since epilepsy is often accompanied with neurological comorbidities such as depression, anxiety and cognitive deficits caused by both the disease and/or drug treatment, we wished to examine the effects of a sub-chronic treatment (>14 consecutive days) with APZ (0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg: i.p.) on both absence seizures and WAG/Rij rat's behavior using different standard paradigms: Open field (OF) test, elevated plus maze (EPM) test, forced swimming (FS) test, sucrose consumption (SC) test and Morris water maze (MWM). WAG/Rij rats represent a validated genetic animal model of absence epilepsy with mild-depression comorbidity, also including other behavioral alterations. APZ treatment showed some anti-absence properties and regarding the behavioral comorbidity in this rat strain, we observed that APZ possesses clear antidepressant effects in the FS and SC tests also increasing memory/learning function in the Morris water maze test. In the two anxiety models used, APZ showed only minor effects.

Its therapeutic indications were extended to acute manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder. In addition, APZ was approved as an adjunct therapy for major depressive disorder in 2007. Compared to other antipsychotic drugs, APZ has a unique pharmacological profile. It is a partial agonist at D2 dopamine receptors and serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptors, whereas it is an antagonist at serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT6 receptors. Since epilepsy is often accompanied with neurological comorbidities such as depression, anxiety and cognitive deficits caused by both the disease and/or drug treatment, we wished to examine the effects of a sub-chronic treatment (>14 consecutive days) with APZ (0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg: i.p.) on both absence seizures and WAG/Rij rat's behavior using different standard paradigms: Open field (OF) test, elevated plus maze (EPM) test, forced swimming (FS) test, sucrose consumption (SC) test and Morris water maze (MWM). WAG/Rij rats represent a validated genetic animal model of absence epilepsy with mild-depression comorbidity, also including other behavioral alterations. APZ treatment showed some anti-absence properties and regarding the behavioral comorbidity in this rat strain, we observed that APZ possesses clear antidepressant effects in the FS and SC tests also increasing memory/learning function in the Morris water maze test. In the two anxiety models used, APZ showed only minor effects. In conclusion, our results indicate that APZ might actually have a potential in treating absence seizures or as add-on therapy but more interestingly, these effect might be accompanied by positive modulatory actions on depression, anxiety and memory which might be also beneficial in other epileptic syndromes.

A profound reduction in mesolimbic dopaminergic transmission was found in iuGC animals, suggesting a key role for dopamine (DA) in the etiology of the observed behavioral deficits. Confirming this idea, we present evidence that a simple pharmacological approach-acute L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (L-DOPA) oral administration, is able to normalize DA levels in iuGC animals, with a concomitant amelioration of several dimensions of the emotional and social behaviors. Interestingly, L-DOPA effects in control individuals were not so straightforward: suggesting that both hypo-and hyperdopaminergia are detrimental in the context of such complex behaviors.",NA,"Univ Minho, Sch Hlth Sci, Life & Hlth Sci Res Inst ICVS, P-4710057 Braga, Portugal and ICVS 3Bs PT Govt Associate Lab, Braga, Portugal","2013","10.1038/npp.2013.108","JOUR","anhedonia and social behavior and dopamine and mesolimbic circuit and depression and 50-KHZ ULTRASONIC VOCALIZATIONS and ANTENATAL GLUCOCORTICOIDS and NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS and MAJOR DEPRESSION and CHILDHOOD TRAUMA and HPA AXIS and BEHAVIOR and RATS and DEXAMETHASONE and STRESS",NA,"WOS:000323165500026",2023-10-10 14:14:08,"4f0df68a-cad3-4a3a-8c46-91f93b86e91f","screening_decisions_GALENOSLSR1project",FALSE,"3eed8e8f-ea6f-48ba-a768-a5578c431862","Francesca Tinsdeall","Animal","None specified",FALSE,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Vehicle",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Dopamine-related non behavioural outcome",NA,"Minutes","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Ratio",FALSE,"Male","WT","Rat","Wistar (rat)","Lower bound of range (put range in comments)",NA,NA,NA,12,14,"Weeks","Weight not reported",NA,NA,NA,NA,"Grams (g)","No",2024-01-26 13:22:05,"f12dad59-6e5e-455f-b87d-477797a48455","Dopamine and DOPAC concentration","DOPAC concentration (NAcc)","09a15756-9f54-4894-9dcc-3979fcc2a09e","ecb1edf2-757b-4d12-9856-be34188e76b7",5,TRUE,NA,NA,TRUE,NA,NA,"True",NA,"fa4125ed-af5e-4c1b-859a-0a6e2848b2e2",NA,"Sham","vehicle","Negative control",NA,FALSE,0,1.16,"Mean","ng/mg",0.17,"SEM",NA,"8659337c-8158-4bed-9dde-de0d3ce3d525.f12dad59-6e5e-455f-b87d-477797a48455.09a15756-9f54-4894-9dcc-3979fcc2a09e.0",NA,"S",NA,NA,"NA, NA NA","NA, NA NA",NA,NA,"8659337c-8158-4bed-9dde-de0d3ce3d525","Dopaminergic Modulation of Affective and Social Deficits Induced by Prenatal Glucocorticoid Exposure","Borges, S and Coimbra, B and Soares-Cunha, C and Pego, JM and Sousa, N and Rodrigues, AJ",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"2013",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Male",NA,"Rat","Wistar (rat)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"DOPAC concentration",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"CvS","Dopamine-related non behavioural outcome",NA,NA,"0ce90632-afef-408c-9dc4-c5ed18074686","control: vehicle (DA DOPAC)",5,1.16,0.17,0.380131556174964,"iuGC: vehicle (DA DOPAC)",5,0.73,0.17,0.380131556174964,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,-1.02112657361757,0.452134973967398,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Prophylactic","Rat","Wistar (rat)","Male",NA,NA,NA,"DOPAC concentration",0,"0 criteria met","No low RoB items",12,"D: 12-15 criteria met","Pharmacological: Early",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

They do not support the hypothesis that the sensitization of D-2-receptors seen following chronic antidepressant treatment is caused by a down-regulation of D-1-receptors.",NA,"UNIV COLL SWANSEA, DEPT PSYCHOL, SWANSEA SA2 8PP, W GLAM, WALES and POLISH ACAD SCI, INST PHARMACOL, PL-31343 KRAKOW, POLAND","1994","10.1007/BF02245566","JOUR","CHRONIC MILD STRESS and IMIPRAMINE and ANIMAL MODEL OF DEPRESSION and DOPAMINE and D-1-RECEPTORS and D-2-RECEPTORS and RAT and ANIMAL-MODEL and NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS and MESOLIMBIC DOPAMINE and LOCOMOTOR RESPONSE and D-AMPHETAMINE and ANTIDEPRESSANTS and DEPRESSION and ATTENUATION and PREFERENCE and RATS",NA,"WOS:A1994PB61000002",2023-10-10 14:14:08,"4f0df68a-cad3-4a3a-8c46-91f93b86e91f","screening_decisions_GALENOSLSR1project",FALSE,"87890e5c-5da6-4669-9742-891aa2e43a82","Fiona Ramage","Animal","Matched-pairs randomisation",FALSE,TRUE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Vehicle",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Dopamine-related non behavioural outcome",5,"Weeks","Measured from figures","Endpoint measurement","Continuous",FALSE,"Male","WT","Rat","Wistar (rat)","Exact number",10,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Days","At recruitment to study",360,9,NA,NA,"Grams (g)","Yes",2024-01-26 16:14:46,"cf0ace21-67d4-4aa1-a077-09b8657cc3de","sucrose intake and dopamine outcomes","D2 receptors limbic forebrain Bmax binding","2042c21c-a498-4cb7-a4f7-dba194c6917f","e418f847-e672-44b5-81e7-b5324ba89949",10,TRUE,NA,NA,TRUE,NA,NA,"True",NA,"07a38ad0-7733-4f7a-b0ca-91b61de73626",NA,"Sham","Vehicle","Negative control",NA,FALSE,0,6.2,"Mean","pmol/g",0.2,"SEM",NA,"08e83c8f-49d3-49dd-a895-20dbd253f719.cf0ace21-67d4-4aa1-a077-09b8657cc3de.2042c21c-a498-4cb7-a4f7-dba194c6917f.0",NA,"S",NA,NA,"NA, NA NA","NA, NA NA",NA,NA,"08e83c8f-49d3-49dd-a895-20dbd253f719","PARALLEL CHANGES IN DOPAMINE-D-2 RECEPTOR-BINDING IN LIMBIC FOREBRAIN ASSOCIATED WITH CHRONIC MILD STRESS-INDUCED ANHEDONIA AND ITS REVERSAL BY IMIPRAMINE","PAPP, M and KLIMEK, V and WILLNER, P",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"1994",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Male",NA,"Rat","Wistar (rat)",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Dopamine receptor biology",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SEM",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"CvS","Dopamine-related non behavioural outcome",NA,NA,"a6e55082-22cb-4921-9aa9-277efc9d6879","Control + vehicle",10,6.2,0.2,0.632455532033676,"CMS + vehicle",10,3.5,0.2,0.632455532033676,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,FALSE,-4.08826426839819,0.617847618206535,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Prophylactic","Rat","Wistar (rat)","Male",NA,NA,NA,"Dopamine receptor biology",2,"2 criteria met","Some low RoB items",12,"D: 12-15 criteria met","Behavioural: CUMS",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

There are sex differences in the symptomatology and treatment response to this disorder. Impairments in behavioral activation (i.e. anergia, fatigue) are often seen in people with depression and are highly resistant to treatment. The role of mesolimbic dopamine (DA) in regulating behavioral activation has been extensively studied in male rodents, but little is known in female rodents. OBJECTIVE: The present studies assessed potential sex differences in rodent paradigms used to study different components of depressive-like behavior, and in the treatment response to antidepressants with different mechanisms of action. METHODS: Male and female CD1 mice received Tetrabenazine (TBZ), a VMAT-2 blocker that depletes DA and induces depressive symptoms in humans. Mice were tested on the Forced Swim Test, (FST), the Dark-Light box (DL), the elevated plus maze (EPM), Social Interaction (SI) test, and sucrose preference and consumption using the two bottles test. In addition, bupropion (a DA reuptake inhibitor) or fluoxetine (a serotonin reuptake inhibitor) were used to reverse TBZ-induced anergia. RESULTS: In the FST, bupropion reversed TBZ effects in both sexes but fluoxetine was only effective in female mice.

Recently, we identified its extracting components and looked for the potentials in treatment for depression by improving the function of monoamine neurotransmitters. AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

Recently, we identified its extracting components and looked for the potentials in treatment for depression by improving the function of monoamine neurotransmitters. AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

In turn, emotional deficits may interfere with the quality and degree of social interaction. Here, by using a comprehensive behavioral approach in combination with the measurement of ultrasonic vocalizations, we show that in utero GC (iuGC)-exposed animals present increased immobility in the forced swimming test, pronounced anhedonic behavior (both anticipatory and consummatory), and an impairment in social interaction at different life stages. Importantly, we also found that social behavioral expression is highly dependent on the affective status of the partner.

AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

The role of D2Rs in chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced depression-like behaviors is not clear. Quinpirole (a D2R agonist) and eticlopride (a D2R antagonist) were stereotactically delivered into the NAc before Sprague Dawley rats underwent CUS. CUS-induced depression-like behaviors were accompanied by a significant decrease in both the dopamine (DA) level and D2R expression in the NAc. Eticlopride reversed CUS-induced depression-like behavior and rescued the DA levels in the NAc, and microinjection of DA into the NAc of CUS individuals had the same effect as eticlopride. By contrast, delivery of quinpirole into the NAc of control animals induced depression-like behaviors accompanied by a decrease in the DA level in the NAc. These results show that DA plays a key role in CUS-induced depression-like behaviors and the D2R exerts a presynaptic negative feedback on DA levels during CUS. Microinjection of quinpirole into the NAc also decreased the level of the kalirin-7 protein in the NAc of both control and stressed animals, while eticlopride increased its level in the NAc of rats. In agreement with these results, intraperitoneal injection of eticlopride in mice also caused an increase in both the kalirin-7 protein level in the NAc and spine density in MSNs, while quinpirole reduced them. These results suggest that regulation of kalirin-7 through D2R in the NAc is a general pathway in rats and mice, and is involved in CUS-induced depression-like behaviors.

The role of D2Rs in chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced depression-like behaviors is not clear. Quinpirole (a D2R agonist) and eticlopride (a D2R antagonist) were stereotactically delivered into the NAc before Sprague Dawley rats underwent CUS. CUS-induced depression-like behaviors were accompanied by a significant decrease in both the dopamine (DA) level and D2R expression in the NAc. Eticlopride reversed CUS-induced depression-like behavior and rescued the DA levels in the NAc, and microinjection of DA into the NAc of CUS individuals had the same effect as eticlopride. By contrast, delivery of quinpirole into the NAc of control animals induced depression-like behaviors accompanied by a decrease in the DA level in the NAc. These results show that DA plays a key role in CUS-induced depression-like behaviors and the D2R exerts a presynaptic negative feedback on DA levels during CUS. Microinjection of quinpirole into the NAc also decreased the level of the kalirin-7 protein in the NAc of both control and stressed animals, while eticlopride increased its level in the NAc of rats. In agreement with these results, intraperitoneal injection of eticlopride in mice also caused an increase in both the kalirin-7 protein level in the NAc and spine density in MSNs, while quinpirole reduced them. These results suggest that regulation of kalirin-7 through D2R in the NAc is a general pathway in rats and mice, and is involved in CUS-induced depression-like behaviors. Kalirin-7 may be directly regulated through the D2R postsynaptic pathway or indirectly through the presynaptic pathway in the NAc. The interaction between D2R and kalirin-7 needs to be investigated further.

The role of D2Rs in chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced depression-like behaviors is not clear. Quinpirole (a D2R agonist) and eticlopride (a D2R antagonist) were stereotactically delivered into the NAc before Sprague Dawley rats underwent CUS. CUS-induced depression-like behaviors were accompanied by a significant decrease in both the dopamine (DA) level and D2R expression in the NAc. Eticlopride reversed CUS-induced depression-like behavior and rescued the DA levels in the NAc, and microinjection of DA into the NAc of CUS individuals had the same effect as eticlopride. By contrast, delivery of quinpirole into the NAc of control animals induced depression-like behaviors accompanied by a decrease in the DA level in the NAc. These results show that DA plays a key role in CUS-induced depression-like behaviors and the D2R exerts a presynaptic negative feedback on DA levels during CUS. Microinjection of quinpirole into the NAc also decreased the level of the kalirin-7 protein in the NAc of both control and stressed animals, while eticlopride increased its level in the NAc of rats. In agreement with these results, intraperitoneal injection of eticlopride in mice also caused an increase in both the kalirin-7 protein level in the NAc and spine density in MSNs, while quinpirole reduced them. These results suggest that regulation of kalirin-7 through D2R in the NAc is a general pathway in rats and mice, and is involved in CUS-induced depression-like behaviors. Kalirin-7 may be directly regulated through the D2R postsynaptic pathway or indirectly through the presynaptic pathway in the NAc.

OBJECTIVE: The present studies assessed potential sex differences in rodent paradigms used to study different components of depressive-like behavior, and in the treatment response to antidepressants with different mechanisms of action. METHODS: Male and female CD1 mice received Tetrabenazine (TBZ), a VMAT-2 blocker that depletes DA and induces depressive symptoms in humans.

OBJECTIVE: The present studies assessed potential sex differences in rodent paradigms used to study different components of depressive-like behavior, and in the treatment response to antidepressants with different mechanisms of action. METHODS: Male and female CD1 mice received Tetrabenazine (TBZ), a VMAT-2 blocker that depletes DA and induces depressive symptoms in humans. Mice were tested on the Forced Swim Test, (FST), the Dark-Light box (DL), the elevated plus maze (EPM), Social Interaction (SI) test, and sucrose preference and consumption using the two bottles test.

Yang S and Fang P and Deng ZF and Xiao JL and Hu ZL and Chen JG","The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology",NA,"BACKGROUND: SKF83959 stimulates the phospholipase CÎ²/inositol phosphate 3 pathway, resulting in the activation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±, which affects the synthesis of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a neurotrophic factor critical for the pathophysiology of depression. Previous reports showed that SKF83959 elicited antidepressant activity in the forced swim test and tail suspension test as a novel triple reuptake inhibitor. However, there are no studies showing the effects of SKF83959 in a chronic stress model of depression and the role of phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±/brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway in SKF83959-mediated antidepressant effects. METHODS: In this study, SKF83959 was firstly investigated in the chronic social defeat stress model of depression. The changes in hippocampal neurogenesis, dendrite spine density, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway after chronic social defeat stress and SKF83959 treatment were then investigated. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA/short hairpin RNA methods were further used to explore the antidepressive mechanisms of SKF83959. RESULTS: We found that SKF83959 produced antidepressant effects in the chronic social defeat stress model and also restored the chronic social defeat stress-induced decrease in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway, dendritic spine density, and neurogenesis. By using various inhibitors and siRNA/shRNA methods, we further demonstrated that the hippocampal dopamine D5 receptor, phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/ calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ± pathway, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor system are all necessary for the SKF83959 effects.

Previous reports showed that SKF83959 elicited antidepressant activity in the forced swim test and tail suspension test as a novel triple reuptake inhibitor. However, there are no studies showing the effects of SKF83959 in a chronic stress model of depression and the role of phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±/brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway in SKF83959-mediated antidepressant effects. METHODS: In this study, SKF83959 was firstly investigated in the chronic social defeat stress model of depression. The changes in hippocampal neurogenesis, dendrite spine density, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway after chronic social defeat stress and SKF83959 treatment were then investigated. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA/short hairpin RNA methods were further used to explore the antidepressive mechanisms of SKF83959. RESULTS: We found that SKF83959 produced antidepressant effects in the chronic social defeat stress model and also restored the chronic social defeat stress-induced decrease in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway, dendritic spine density, and neurogenesis. By using various inhibitors and siRNA/shRNA methods, we further demonstrated that the hippocampal dopamine D5 receptor, phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/ calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ± pathway, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor system are all necessary for the SKF83959 effects. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SKF83959 can be developed as a novel antidepressant and produces antidepressant effects via the hippocampal D5/ phospholipase C/inositol phosphate

Previous reports showed that SKF83959 elicited antidepressant activity in the forced swim test and tail suspension test as a novel triple reuptake inhibitor. However, there are no studies showing the effects of SKF83959 in a chronic stress model of depression and the role of phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±/brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway in SKF83959-mediated antidepressant effects. METHODS: In this study, SKF83959 was firstly investigated in the chronic social defeat stress model of depression. The changes in hippocampal neurogenesis, dendrite spine density, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway after chronic social defeat stress and SKF83959 treatment were then investigated. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA/short hairpin RNA methods were further used to explore the antidepressive mechanisms of SKF83959. RESULTS: We found that SKF83959 produced antidepressant effects in the chronic social defeat stress model and also restored the chronic social defeat stress-induced decrease in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway, dendritic spine density, and neurogenesis. By using various inhibitors and siRNA/shRNA methods, we further demonstrated that the hippocampal dopamine D5 receptor, phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/ calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ± pathway, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor system are all necessary for the SKF83959 effects. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SKF83959 can be developed as a novel antidepressant and produces antidepressant effects via the hippocampal D5/ phospholipase C/inositol phosphate

Recently, we identified its extracting components and looked for the potentials in treatment for depression by improving the function of monoamine neurotransmitters. AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

Disorders of monoamine neurotransmitters and their receptors may be the fundamental causes of depression. Additionally, abnormal expression of glutamic acid (Glu) and its receptor may be a major reason for depression. Consequently, the study of the relationship between monoamine and glutamic acid neurotransmitter in stress-induced depression has significances to reveal the profound mechanism of depression. NR2B subunits which are highly expressed in the cortex, hippocampus and olfactory bulb, are one of the key subunits of NMDA receptors. Orbital frontal cortex (orbital frontal cortex, OFC), which plays a significant role in higher brain function, such as emotional and complex behavior, is one of the major sub-regions of prefrontal. This study was to investigate the effect of orbital frontal cortex D1 dopamine receptor on Glu and its receptors, especially on NR2B subunits of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors in depression induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). CUMS-induced depression model was established in Sprague-Dawley rats, and intra-orbital frontal cortex microinjections of D1 dopamine receptor agonist SKF38393 and its antagonist SCH23390 were respectively adopted by rat brain stereotaxic coordinates. The behavioral observations were conducted by measurement of sucrose preference test, open-field test and tail suspension test. The concentration of Glu and the expression of NR2B subunits in orbital frontal cortex were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and Western blot (WB) respectively. In comparison to control groups, depression-like behavioral changes were observed in CUMS rats, the concentration of dopamine and its D1 receptor were decreased: conversely, the increase of Glu and NR2B subunits of its NMDA receptors were observed in orbital frontal cortex. Depression-like behavioral of CUMS rats was obviously improved after pretreatment with injection of SKF38393, the expression of Glu and NR2B subunits of its NMDA receptors were also decreased. Normal rats showed depression-like behavioral which similar to the CUMS rats after pretreatment with injection of D1 dopamine receptor antagonist SCH23390, meanwhile, in orbital frontal cortex the expression of Glu and NR2B subunits of its NMDA receptors were significantly increased. These results suggest that the lowered dopamine release may be caused by chronic unpredictable mild stress, as the result of insufficient dopamine, orbital frontal cortex releases extra amounts of glutamic acid and its NMDA receptors are over activated. All those above then may lead to depression. Antidepressant effect of dopamine may be functioned by inhibiting the expression of Glu and NR2B subunits of its NMDA receptors.

Selegiline is an irreversible monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B inhibitor which increases striatal dopamine levels and exerts an antidepressant effect. In this study, 180min of MS stress was applied to mice at postnatal day (PND) 2-14 followed by behavioral tests for determining depressive-like behaviors, such as forced swimming test (FST), splash test and sucrose preference test (SPT) in adult mice (PND 50). The open field test (OFT) also was applied to validate FST results. We used SCH23390 (D1 antagonist) and sulpiride (D2 antagonist) in order to determine the role of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in antidepressant-like effects of selegiline. Our results revealed that MS provoked depressive-like behaviors in adult male mice, and the administration of selegiline attenuated depressive-like behaviors in MS mice. Our findings showed that D1 dopamine receptors facilitate the positive effects of selegiline on the passive behavior in the FST. Furthermore, antidepressant effects of selegiline on hedonic difficulties are mediated via D2 receptor in the SPT. The results of the splash test revealed that both D1 and D2 receptors mediate the protective effect of selegiline against motivational and self-care problems. Based on our results, we conclude that both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors are involved in mediating the antidepressant-like effect of selegiline. We found that D1 receptors mediate an effect on despair behavior, D2 receptors mediate an effect on anhedonia, and both D1 and D2 receptors contribute to the protective effects of selegiline on motivational complications.

OBJECTIVE: The present studies assessed potential sex differences in rodent paradigms used to study different components of depressive-like behavior, and in the treatment response to antidepressants with different mechanisms of action. METHODS: Male and female CD1 mice received Tetrabenazine (TBZ), a VMAT-2 blocker that depletes DA and induces depressive symptoms in humans. Mice were tested on the Forced Swim Test, (FST), the Dark-Light box (DL), the elevated plus maze (EPM), Social Interaction (SI) test, and sucrose preference and consumption using the two bottles test. In addition, bupropion (a DA reuptake inhibitor) or fluoxetine (a serotonin reuptake inhibitor) were used to reverse TBZ-induced anergia. RESULTS: In the FST, bupropion reversed TBZ effects in both sexes but fluoxetine was only effective in female mice. DA depletion did not affect other aspects of depression such as anxiety, sociability or sucrose consumption, and there was no interaction with bupropion on these parameters.

The role of D2Rs in chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced depression-like behaviors is not clear. Quinpirole (a D2R agonist) and eticlopride (a D2R antagonist) were stereotactically delivered into the NAc before Sprague Dawley rats underwent CUS. CUS-induced depression-like behaviors were accompanied by a significant decrease in both the dopamine (DA) level and D2R expression in the NAc. Eticlopride reversed CUS-induced depression-like behavior and rescued the DA levels in the NAc, and microinjection of DA into the NAc of CUS individuals had the same effect as eticlopride. By contrast, delivery of quinpirole into the NAc of control animals induced depression-like behaviors accompanied by a decrease in the DA level in the NAc. These results show that DA plays a key role in CUS-induced depression-like behaviors and the D2R exerts a presynaptic negative feedback on DA levels during CUS. Microinjection of quinpirole into the NAc also decreased the level of the kalirin-7 protein in the NAc of both control and stressed animals, while eticlopride increased its level in the NAc of rats. In agreement with these results, intraperitoneal injection of eticlopride in mice also caused an increase in both the kalirin-7 protein level in the NAc and spine density in MSNs, while quinpirole reduced them. These results suggest that regulation of kalirin-7 through D2R in the NAc is a general pathway in rats and mice, and is involved in CUS-induced depression-like behaviors. Kalirin-7 may be directly regulated through the D2R postsynaptic pathway or indirectly through the presynaptic pathway in the NAc.

AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

Recently, we identified its extracting components and looked for the potentials in treatment for depression by improving the function of monoamine neurotransmitters. AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

Partial D2 receptor agonism is thought to stabilize dopaminergic neurotransmission in the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways. Dysregulation in the dopamine and serotonin systems is known to be one of the factors that is responsible for the etiology of depression. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the antidepressant potential of aripiprazole in rats by studying its effects on dopamine and serotonin receptors. Method: In this study, male Wistar Albino rats of 8-week old were used. They were divided into 4 groups, each of which consisted of 8 rats. As a depression model, the Chronic Mild Stress (CMS) model was used for four weeks on the rats. The first group was the control group and that received saline as a placebo without CMS. For the second group, aripiprazole (2.5 mg/kg) was administered with CMS: for the third group, escitalopram (10 mg/kg) was administered with CMS and for fourth group a placebo (serum physiologic) was given with CMS. Additionally a sucrose consumption test was performed before and after the CMS model. Results: Sucrose intake at the baseline and within the first week of the study did not differ among the groups. The sucrose consumption of the group with CMS was significantly lower than that of the control group during the second, third and fourth weeks. While the consumption of sucrose in the groups who received aripiprazole and escitalopram did not differ from the group which was exposed to CMS at the beginning and during the first and second weeks, it was significantly higher at the third and fourth weeks. The sucrose consumption values of the groups that received aripiprazole and escitalopram were not different from the control group throughout the study. Conclusion: In this study, aripiprazole has been shown to produce an antidepressant effect comparable to that of escitalopram in rats using a model of depression.

As it appears to improve mood, we examined its actions in rodent models of antidepressant properties, in comparison with the prototypical anti-Parkinson agent, apomorphine, the D2/D3 receptor agonist, quinpirole, and the antidepressants, imipramine and fluvoxamine. In the mouse forced-swim test, acute administration of imipramine, fluvoxamine, apomorphine or quinpirole decreased immobility time, actions dose dependently mimicked by piribedil (2.5-10.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously). In rats, acute and subchronic administration of piribedil similarly reduced immobility (0.63-10.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) and apomorphine, quinpirole and imipramine were also active in this test, whereas fluvoxamine was inactive. Both in mice and in rats, the D2/D3 receptor antagonist, raclopride, and the D2 receptor antagonist, L741,626, dose dependently blocked the antidepressant properties of piribedil, whereas the selective D3 receptor antagonists, S33084 and SB277,011, were ineffective. In a chronic mild stress model in rats, piribedil (2.5-40.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) restored sucrose intake in stressed animals exerting its actions more rapidly (by week 1) than imipramine. Imipramine, fluvoxamine, apomorphine, quinpirole and piribedil dose dependently (0.63-10.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) suppressed aggressive and marble-burying behaviour in mice. In the latter procedure, raclopride and L741,626, but not S33084, attenuated the actions of piribedil.

As it appears to improve mood, we examined its actions in rodent models of antidepressant properties, in comparison with the prototypical anti-Parkinson agent, apomorphine, the D2/D3 receptor agonist, quinpirole, and the antidepressants, imipramine and fluvoxamine. In the mouse forced-swim test, acute administration of imipramine, fluvoxamine, apomorphine or quinpirole decreased immobility time, actions dose dependently mimicked by piribedil (2.5-10.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously). In rats, acute and subchronic administration of piribedil similarly reduced immobility (0.63-10.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) and apomorphine, quinpirole and imipramine were also active in this test, whereas fluvoxamine was inactive. Both in mice and in rats, the D2/D3 receptor antagonist, raclopride, and the D2 receptor antagonist, L741,626, dose dependently blocked the antidepressant properties of piribedil, whereas the selective D3 receptor antagonists, S33084 and SB277,011, were ineffective. In a chronic mild stress model in rats, piribedil (2.5-40.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) restored sucrose intake in stressed animals exerting its actions more rapidly (by week 1) than imipramine. Imipramine, fluvoxamine, apomorphine, quinpirole and piribedil dose dependently (0.63-10.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) suppressed aggressive and marble-burying behaviour in mice. In the latter procedure, raclopride and L741,626, but not S33084, attenuated the actions of piribedil. Over a dose range (0.63-10.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) equivalent to those active in models of antidepressant activity, piribedil did not stimulate locomotor behaviour.

In addition, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are still poorly understood. METHODS: We used a mouse model of PSD to examine the neurobiological mechanisms of PSD and the beneficial effects of aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic drug. PSD was induced in mice by combining middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with spatial restraint stress. The body weight, sucrose preference, and forced swim tests were performed at 5, 7, and 9 weeks and the Morris water maze test at 10 weeks after completing MCAO and spatial restraint stress. RESULTS: Mice subjected to MCAO and spatial restraint stress showed significant depressive-like behavior in the sucrose preference test and forced swim test as well as cognitive impairment in the Morris water maze test. The PSD-like phenotype was accompanied by an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) expression increase in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, but not in the striatum. Furthermore, the increased IDO1 levels were localized in Iba-1(+) cells but not in NeuN(+) or GFAP(+) cells, indicating that microglia-induced IDO1 expression was prominent in the PSD mouse brain. Moreover, 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase (HAAO), quinolinic acid (QUIN), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were significantly increased in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus of PSD mice. Importantly, a 2-week aripiprazole (1â€‰mg/kg, per os) regimen, which was initiated 1 day after MCAO, ameliorated depressive-like behavior and impairment of cognitive functions in PSD mice that was accompanied by downregulation of IDO1, HAAO, QUIN, and ROS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the IDO1-dependent neurotoxic kynurenine metabolism induced by microglia functions in PSD pathogenesis. The beneficial effect of aripiprazole on depressive-like behavior and cognitive impairment may be mediated by inhibition of IDO1, HAAO, QUIN, and ROS.",NA,"Department of Korean Medical Science, School

with Spatial Restraint Stress.","Koo YS and Kim H and Park JH and Kim MJ and Shin YI and Choi BT and Lee SY and Shin HK","Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity",NA,"AIM: Poststroke depression (PSD), which occurs in approximately one-third of stroke survivors, is clinically important because of its association with slow functional recovery and increased mortality. In addition, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are still poorly understood. METHODS: We used a mouse model of PSD to examine the neurobiological mechanisms of PSD and the beneficial effects of aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic drug. PSD was induced in mice by combining middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with spatial restraint stress. The body weight, sucrose preference, and forced swim tests were performed at 5, 7, and 9 weeks and the Morris water maze test at 10 weeks after completing MCAO and spatial restraint stress. RESULTS: Mice subjected to MCAO and spatial restraint stress showed significant depressive-like behavior in the sucrose preference test and forced swim test as well as cognitive impairment in the Morris water maze test. The PSD-like phenotype was accompanied by an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) expression increase in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, but not in the striatum. Furthermore, the increased IDO1 levels were localized in Iba-1(+) cells but not in NeuN(+) or GFAP(+) cells, indicating that microglia-induced IDO1 expression was prominent in the PSD mouse brain. Moreover, 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase (HAAO), quinolinic acid (QUIN), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were significantly increased in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus of PSD mice. Importantly, a 2-week aripiprazole (1â€‰mg/kg, per os) regimen, which was initiated 1 day after MCAO, ameliorated depressive-like behavior and impairment of cognitive functions in PSD mice that was accompanied by downregulation of IDO1, HAAO, QUIN, and ROS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the IDO1-dependent neurotoxic kynurenine metabolism induced by microglia functions in PSD pathogenesis. The beneficial effect of aripiprazole on depressive-like behavior and cognitive impairment may be mediated by inhibition of IDO1, HAAO, QUIN, and ROS.",NA,"Department of Korean Medical Science, School

In addition, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are still poorly understood. METHODS: We used a mouse model of PSD to examine the neurobiological mechanisms of PSD and the beneficial effects of aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic drug. PSD was induced in mice by combining middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with spatial restraint stress. The body weight, sucrose preference, and forced swim tests were performed at 5, 7, and 9 weeks and the Morris water maze test at 10 weeks after completing MCAO and spatial restraint stress. RESULTS: Mice subjected to MCAO and spatial restraint stress showed significant depressive-like behavior in the sucrose preference test and forced swim test as well as cognitive impairment in the Morris water maze test. The PSD-like phenotype was accompanied by an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) expression increase in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, but not in the striatum. Furthermore, the increased IDO1 levels were localized in Iba-1(+) cells but not in NeuN(+) or GFAP(+) cells, indicating that microglia-induced IDO1 expression was prominent in the PSD mouse brain. Moreover, 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase (HAAO), quinolinic acid (QUIN), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were significantly increased in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus of PSD mice. Importantly, a 2-week aripiprazole (1â€‰mg/kg, per os) regimen, which was initiated 1 day after MCAO, ameliorated depressive-like behavior and impairment of cognitive functions in PSD mice that was accompanied by downregulation of IDO1, HAAO, QUIN, and ROS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the IDO1-dependent neurotoxic kynurenine metabolism induced by microglia functions in PSD pathogenesis. The beneficial effect of aripiprazole on depressive-like behavior and cognitive impairment may be mediated by inhibition of IDO1, HAAO, QUIN, and ROS.",NA,"Department of Korean Medical Science, School

(PSD), which occurs in approximately one-third of stroke survivors, is clinically important because of its association with slow functional recovery and increased mortality. In addition, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are still poorly understood. METHODS: We used a mouse model of PSD to examine the neurobiological mechanisms of PSD and the beneficial effects of aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic drug. PSD was induced in mice by combining middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with spatial restraint stress. The body weight, sucrose preference, and forced swim tests were performed at 5, 7, and 9 weeks and the Morris water maze test at 10 weeks after completing MCAO and spatial restraint stress. RESULTS: Mice subjected to MCAO and spatial restraint stress showed significant depressive-like behavior in the sucrose preference test and forced swim test as well as cognitive impairment in the Morris water maze test. The PSD-like phenotype was accompanied by an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) expression increase in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, but not in the striatum. Furthermore, the increased IDO1 levels were localized in Iba-1(+) cells but not in NeuN(+) or GFAP(+) cells, indicating that microglia-induced IDO1 expression was prominent in the PSD mouse brain. Moreover, 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase (HAAO), quinolinic acid (QUIN), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were significantly increased in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus of PSD mice. Importantly, a 2-week aripiprazole (1â€‰mg/kg, per os) regimen, which was initiated 1 day after MCAO, ameliorated depressive-like behavior and impairment of cognitive functions in PSD mice that was accompanied by downregulation of IDO1, HAAO, QUIN, and ROS.

Among them, depression is a common psychiatric symptom, and links to poorer recovery. Amantadine, as an antiparkinsonian, increases dopamine release, and blocks dopamine reuptake, but has recently received attention for its effectiveness as an antidepressant. In the present study, we first induced a post-TBI depression rat model to probe the efficacy of amantadine therapy in reducing post-TBI depression. The DA concentration in the striatum of the injured rats, as well as the degeneration and apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), were checked along with the depression-like behavior. The results showed that amantadine therapy could significantly ameliorate the depression-like behavior, improving the DA level in the striatum and decreasing the degeneration and apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons in the SN.

The DA concentration in the striatum of the injured rats, as well as the degeneration and apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), were checked along with the depression-like behavior. The results showed that amantadine therapy could significantly ameliorate the depression-like behavior, improving the DA level in the striatum and decreasing the degeneration and apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons in the SN. The results indicated that the anti-depression effect may result from the increase of extracellular DA concentration in the striatum and/or the indirect neuroprotection on the dopaminergic neurons in the SN. We conclude that DA plays a critical role in post-TBI depression, and that amantadine shows its potential value in anti-depression treatment for TBI.
