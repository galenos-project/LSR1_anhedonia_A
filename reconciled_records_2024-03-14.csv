In the present study, 5 weeks of treatment with imipramine (10 mg/kg b.i.d.) reversed the decreased sucrose intake of rats exposed to chronic mild stress. Stress also caused a decrease in D-2-receptor binding in the limbic forebrain (but not the striatum), which was completely reversed by imipramine. In nonstressed animals, imipramine decreased D-1-receptor binding in both regions. However, in stressed animals, imipramine did not significantly alter D-1-receptor binding in either area. Stress alone slightly increased D-1-receptor binding, in striatum only.

Interestingly, age at methylphenidate exposure appears to be a critical determinant influencing the expression of affective behaviors. In the present study, we exposed rats to methylphenidate during the preweanling period (i.e., PD 11-PD 20) because this ontogenetic period is analogous to early childhood in humans (an age associated with increasing methylphenidate usage). Rats were injected with methylphenidate (0, 2, or 5 mg/kg) from PD 11 to PD 20 and reactivity to rewarding and aversive stimuli were measured in early adulthood. Specifically, novelty-induced CPP, sucrose preference, and elevated plus maze behavior were assessed on PD 60.

Among them, depression is a common psychiatric symptom, and links to poorer recovery. Amantadine, as an antiparkinsonian, increases dopamine release, and blocks dopamine reuptake, but has recently received attention for its effectiveness as an antidepressant. In the present study, we first induced a post-TBI depression rat model to probe the efficacy of amantadine therapy in reducing post-TBI depression. The DA concentration in the striatum of the injured rats, as well as the degeneration and apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), were checked along with the depression-like behavior. The results showed that amantadine therapy could significantly ameliorate the depression-like behavior, improving the DA level in the striatum and decreasing the degeneration and apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons in the SN. The results indicated that the anti-depression effect may result from the increase of extracellular DA concentration in the striatum and/or the indirect neuroprotection on the dopaminergic neurons in the SN.

The results showed that amantadine therapy could significantly ameliorate the depression-like behavior, improving the DA level in the striatum and decreasing the degeneration and apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons in the SN. The results indicated that the anti-depression effect may result from the increase of extracellular DA concentration in the striatum and/or the indirect neuroprotection on the dopaminergic neurons in the SN. We conclude that DA plays a critical role in post-TBI depression, and that amantadine shows its potential value in anti-depression treatment for TBI.

In the present study, we first induced a post-TBI depression rat model to probe the efficacy of amantadine therapy in reducing post-TBI depression. The DA concentration in the striatum of the injured rats, as well as the degeneration and apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN), were checked along with the depression-like behavior.

The results showed that amantadine therapy could significantly ameliorate the depression-like behavior, improving the DA level in the striatum and decreasing the degeneration and apoptosis of dopaminergic neurons in the SN. The results indicated that the anti-depression effect may result from the increase of extracellular DA concentration in the striatum and/or the indirect neuroprotection on the dopaminergic neurons in the SN. We conclude that DA plays a critical role in post-TBI depression, and that amantadine shows its potential value in anti-depression treatment for TBI.

In addition, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are still poorly understood. METHODS: We used a mouse model of PSD to examine the neurobiological mechanisms of PSD and the beneficial effects of aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic drug. PSD was induced in mice by combining middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with spatial restraint stress. The body weight, sucrose preference, and forced swim tests were performed at 5, 7, and 9 weeks and the Morris water maze test at 10 weeks after completing MCAO and spatial restraint stress. RESULTS: Mice subjected to MCAO and spatial restraint stress showed significant depressive-like behavior in the sucrose preference test and forced swim test as well as cognitive impairment in the Morris water maze test. The PSD-like phenotype was accompanied by an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) expression increase in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, but not in the striatum. Furthermore, the increased IDO1 levels were localized in Iba-1(+) cells but not in NeuN(+) or GFAP(+) cells, indicating that microglia-induced IDO1 expression was prominent in the PSD mouse brain. Moreover, 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase (HAAO), quinolinic acid (QUIN), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were significantly increased in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus of PSD mice. Importantly, a 2-week aripiprazole (1â€‰mg/kg, per os) regimen, which was initiated 1 day after MCAO, ameliorated depressive-like behavior and impairment of cognitive functions in PSD mice that was accompanied by downregulation of IDO1, HAAO, QUIN, and ROS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the IDO1-dependent neurotoxic kynurenine metabolism induced by microglia functions in PSD pathogenesis.

In addition, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are still poorly understood. METHODS: We used a mouse model of PSD to examine the neurobiological mechanisms of PSD and the beneficial effects of aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic drug. PSD was induced in mice by combining middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) with spatial restraint stress. The body weight, sucrose preference, and forced swim tests were performed at 5, 7, and 9 weeks and the Morris water maze test at 10 weeks after completing MCAO and spatial restraint stress. RESULTS: Mice subjected to MCAO and spatial restraint stress showed significant depressive-like behavior in the sucrose preference test and forced swim test as well as cognitive impairment in the Morris water maze test. The PSD-like phenotype was accompanied by an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) expression increase in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus, but not in the striatum. Furthermore, the increased IDO1 levels were localized in Iba-1(+) cells but not in NeuN(+) or GFAP(+) cells, indicating that microglia-induced IDO1 expression was prominent in the PSD mouse brain. Moreover, 3-hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-dioxygenase (HAAO), quinolinic acid (QUIN), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were significantly increased in the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, and hypothalamus of PSD mice. Importantly, a 2-week aripiprazole (1â€‰mg/kg, per os) regimen, which was initiated 1 day after MCAO, ameliorated depressive-like behavior and impairment of cognitive functions in PSD mice that was accompanied by downregulation of IDO1, HAAO, QUIN, and ROS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the IDO1-dependent neurotoxic kynurenine metabolism induced by microglia functions in PSD pathogenesis.

Despite the high prevalence of depression, there is no clear guidance for its treatment in PD because the evidence for the efficacy of most antidepressants remains insufficient. Pramipexole, a dopamine agonist, is one of the few drugs that has proven to be clinically useful. However, the underlying mechanisms of antidepressive effects of pramipexole are still unknown. A 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model, dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) and D3 receptor (DRD3) knockout mice were used in our study. Compared with other dopamine D2-like receptor agonists and madopar, pramipexole improved depression-like behavior and alleviate bradykinesia in an MPTP-induced mouse model of PD.

Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control, control + AMA, stress and stress + AMA groups. The chronic stress model combined chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) with isolated feeding. Animals were exposed to CUS continued for 21 days. AMA (25 mg/kg) was administrated p.o. for 20 days from the 4th day of CUS to the 23rd. Weight and sucrose consumption were measured during model establishing period. Spatial memory was evaluated using the Morris water maze (MWM) test. Following MWM testing, both long-term potentiation (LTP) and depotentiation were recorded in the hippocampal CA1 region. NR2B and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) proteins were measured by Western-blot analysis. AMA increased weight and sucrose consumption of stressed rats. Spatial memory and reversal learning in stressed rats were impaired relative to controls, whereas AMA significantly attenuated cognitive impairment. AMA also mitigated the chronic stress-induced impairment of hippocampal synaptic plasticity, in which both the LTP and depotentiation were significantly inhibited in stressed rats.

Recently, we identified its extracting components and looked for the potentials in treatment for depression by improving the function of monoamine neurotransmitters. AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that S4 was a potential inhibitor of MAO reuptake that could rescue depression in a CUMS-model rats by restoring monoamine neurotransmitters in different encephalic regions.",NA,"Guangdong Engineering & Technology Research Center for Quality and Efficacy and Reevaluation of Post-Market Traditional Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of and Biocontrol and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, School of and Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 135 Xingang Xi Road, Guangzhou, 510275, and China: Formula-Pattern Research Center, School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632, China. and Guangdong Engineering & Technology Research Center for Quality and Efficacy and Reevaluation of Post-Market Traditional Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of and Biocontrol and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, School of and Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 135 Xingang Xi Road, Guangzhou, 510275, and China. and Guangdong Engineering & Technology Research Center for Quality and Efficacy and Reevaluation of Post-Market Traditional Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of and Biocontrol and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, School of and Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 135 Xingang Xi Road, Guangzhou, 510275, and China. and Guangdong Engineering & Technology Research Center for Quality and Efficacy and Reevaluation of Post-Market Traditional Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of and Biocontrol and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, School of and Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 135 Xingang Xi Road, Guangzhou, 510275, and China. and Guangdong Engineering & Technology Research Center for Quality and Efficacy and Reevaluation of Post-Market Traditional Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of and Biocontrol and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, School of and Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 135 Xingang Xi Road, Guangzhou, 510275, and China. and Guangdong Engineering & Technology Research Center for Quality and Efficacy and Reevaluation of Post-Market Traditional Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of and Biocontrol and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, School of and Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 135 Xingang Xi Road, Guangzhou, 510275, and China. and Guangdong Engineering & Technology Research Center for Quality and Efficacy and Reevaluation of Post-Market Traditional Chinese Medicine, State Key Laboratory of and Biocontrol and Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, School of and Life Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University, 135 Xingang Xi Road, Guangzhou, 510275, and China.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4.

After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids.

AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters.

After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids.

AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists.

AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

Recently, we identified its extracting components and looked for the potentials in treatment for depression by improving the function of monoamine neurotransmitters. AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters.

After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids.

AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids.

Recently, we identified its extracting components and looked for the potentials in treatment for depression by improving the function of monoamine neurotransmitters. AIM OF THE STUDY: We investigated the mechanism of action of the seed extracts of P. orientalis (S4) to rescue depressive behavior in a chronic, unpredicted, mild stress (CUMS)-induced model in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole-time of flight tandem mass spectrometry to analyze the chemical constituents in S4. An assay platform in zebrafish and molecular docking were used to analyze if S4 regulated rest/wake behavior and predict the biological targets which correlated with monoamine neurotransmitters. Depressive-behavior tests (body weight, sucrose preference test, tail-suspension test, forced-swimming test) were carried in the CUMS model. After behavior tests and killing, rat brains were separated into the hippocampus, frontier cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus. The main monoamine neurotransmitters and their metabolite concentrations in these three brain regions were measured by rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Forty-one compounds were identified in S4, including fatty acids, terpenoids, amino acids, plant sterols and flavonoids. S4 could increase the total rest time and decrease the waking activity of zebrafish. S4 showed high correlation with adrenaline agonists, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors and dopamine agonists. CUMS-group rats, compared with controls, had significantly decreased body weight and preference for sucrose water, whereas the immobility time in the tail-suspension test and forced-swimming test was increased. S4 could significantly rescue the increased levels of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus.

Here, we determined the neuroimmune effects of different classes of ADs by using the LPS inflammatory model of depression. METHODS: Male rats received amitriptyline (AMI) a tricyclic, S-citalopram (ESC) a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, tranylcypromine (TCP) a monoamine oxidase inhibitor, vortioxetine (VORT) a multimodal AD or saline for ten days. One-hour after the last AD administration, rats were exposed to LPS 0.83Â mg/kg or saline and 24Â h later were tested for depressive-like behavior. Plasma corticosterone, brain levels of nitrite, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, phospho-cAMP Response Element-Binding Protein (CREB) and nuclear factor (NF)-kB p 65 were determined. RESULTS: LPS induced despair-like, impaired motivation/self-care behavior and caused anhedonia. All ADs prevented LPS-induced despair-like behavior, but only VORT rescued impaired self-care behavior. All ADs prevented LPS-induced increase in brain pro-inflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-1Î² and IL-6] and T-helper 1 cytokines [tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î± and interferon-Î³]. VORT increased striatal and hypothalamic IL-4 levels. All ADs prevented LPS-induced neuroendocrine alterations represented by increased levels of hypothalamic nitrite and plasma corticosterone response. VORT and ESC prevented LPS-induced increase in NF-kBp65 hippocampal expression, while ESC, TCP and VORT, but not IMI, prevented the alterations in phospho-CREB expression. LIMITATIONS: LPS model helps to understand depression in a subset of depressed patients with immune activation. The levels of neurotransmitters were not determined.

Partial D2 receptor agonism is thought to stabilize dopaminergic neurotransmission in the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways. Dysregulation in the dopamine and serotonin systems is known to be one of the factors that is responsible for the etiology of depression. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the antidepressant potential of aripiprazole in rats by studying its effects on dopamine and serotonin receptors. Method: In this study, male Wistar Albino rats of 8-week old were used. They were divided into 4 groups, each of which consisted of 8 rats. As a depression model, the Chronic Mild Stress (CMS) model was used for four weeks on the rats. The first group was the control group and that received saline as a placebo without CMS. For the second group, aripiprazole (2.5 mg/kg) was administered with CMS: for the third group, escitalopram (10 mg/kg) was administered with CMS and for fourth group a placebo (serum physiologic) was given with CMS. Additionally a sucrose consumption test was performed before and after the CMS model. Results: Sucrose intake at the baseline and within the first week of the study did not differ among the groups. The sucrose consumption of the group with CMS was significantly lower than that of the control group during the second, third and fourth weeks.

Additionally a sucrose consumption test was performed before and after the CMS model. Results: Sucrose intake at the baseline and within the first week of the study did not differ among the groups. The sucrose consumption of the group with CMS was significantly lower than that of the control group during the second, third and fourth weeks. While the consumption of sucrose in the groups who received aripiprazole and escitalopram did not differ from the group which was exposed to CMS at the beginning and during the first and second weeks, it was significantly higher at the third and fourth weeks.

Method: In this study, male Wistar Albino rats of 8-week old were used. They were divided into 4 groups, each of which consisted of 8 rats. As a depression model, the Chronic Mild Stress (CMS) model was used for four weeks on the rats. The first group was the control group and that received saline as a placebo without CMS. For the second group, aripiprazole (2.5 mg/kg) was administered with CMS: for the third group, escitalopram (10 mg/kg) was administered with CMS and for fourth group a placebo (serum physiologic) was given with CMS. Additionally a sucrose consumption test was performed before and after the CMS model. Results: Sucrose intake at the baseline and within the first week of the study did not differ among the groups. The sucrose consumption of the group with CMS was significantly lower than that of the control group during the second, third and fourth weeks. While the consumption of sucrose in the groups who received aripiprazole and escitalopram did not differ from the group which was exposed to CMS at the beginning and during the first and second weeks, it was significantly higher at the third and fourth weeks. The sucrose consumption values of the groups that received aripiprazole and escitalopram were not different from the control group throughout the study. Conclusion: In this study, aripiprazole has been shown to produce an antidepressant effect comparable to that of escitalopram in rats using a model of depression.

Partial D2 receptor agonism is thought to stabilize dopaminergic neurotransmission in the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways.

PPX reversed the suppression of sucrose intake in stressed male rats, increasing sucrose intakes above the levels seen in untreated nonstressed controls. PPX also increased sucrose intake in nonstressed Ss: these effects were accompanied by increases in water intake and tended to correlate with weight loss.

OBJECTIVES: The investigation focused on the behavioural effects of the recently developed DRD4 agonist, APH199, to evaluate its impact on anxiety, anhedonia, behavioural despair, establishment and retrieval of alcohol reinforcement, and amphetamine (AMPH)-induced symptoms. METHODS: Male C57BL/6Â J mice and Sprague-Dawley rats were examined in five independent experiments.

RESULTS: APH199 caused mild and sporadic anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in EPM and FST, but no remarkable impact on behaviour in other tests in mice.

RESULTS: APH199 caused mild and sporadic anxiolytic and antidepressant effects in EPM and FST, but no remarkable impact on behaviour in other tests in mice. However, we found a significant increase in AMPH-induced hyperactivity, suggesting an exaggeration of the psychotic-like responses in the AMPH-sensitized rats. CONCLUSIONS: Our data challenged the hypothesis of the therapeutic benefits of DRD4 agonists, pointing out a possible aggravation of psychosis. We suggest a need for further preclinical studies to ensure the safety of antipsychotics with DRD4 stimulating properties.",NA,"Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Clinic, and Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Schwabachanlage 6, 91054, and Erlangen, Germany. and Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Friedrich-Alexander-University of and Erlangen-Nuremberg, Nikolaus-Fiebiger-Str. 10, 91058, Erlangen, Germany. and Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Clinic, and Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Schwabachanlage 6, 91054, and Erlangen, Germany. and Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Clinic, and Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Schwabachanlage 6, 91054, and Erlangen, Germany. and Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Clinic, and Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Schwabachanlage 6, 91054, and Erlangen, Germany. and Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Clinic, and Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Schwabachanlage 6, 91054, and Erlangen, Germany. and Department of Experimental Therapy, Preclinical Experimental Center, and Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Palmsanlage 5, 91054, and Erlangen, Germany. and Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Clinic, and Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Schwabachanlage 6, 91054, and Erlangen, Germany. and Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Clinic, and Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Schwabachanlage 6, 91054, and Erlangen, Germany. and Department of Chemistry and Pharmacy, Friedrich-Alexander-University of and Erlangen-Nuremberg, Nikolaus-Fiebiger-Str. 10, 91058, Erlangen, Germany. and Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Clinic, and Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Schwabachanlage 6, 91054, and Erlangen, Germany.

The role of D2Rs in chronic unpredictable stress (CUS)-induced depression-like behaviors is not clear. Quinpirole (a D2R agonist) and eticlopride (a D2R antagonist) were stereotactically delivered into the NAc before Sprague Dawley rats underwent CUS. CUS-induced depression-like behaviors were accompanied by a significant decrease in both the dopamine (DA) level and D2R expression in the NAc. Eticlopride reversed CUS-induced depression-like behavior and rescued the DA levels in the NAc, and microinjection of DA into the NAc of CUS individuals had the same effect as eticlopride. By contrast, delivery of quinpirole into the NAc of control animals induced depression-like behaviors accompanied by a decrease in the DA level in the NAc. These results show that DA plays a key role in CUS-induced depression-like behaviors and the D2R exerts a presynaptic negative feedback on DA levels during CUS. Microinjection of quinpirole into the NAc also decreased the level of the kalirin-7 protein in the NAc of both control and stressed animals, while eticlopride increased its level in the NAc of rats. In agreement with these results, intraperitoneal injection of eticlopride in mice also caused an increase in both the kalirin-7 protein level in the NAc and spine density in MSNs, while quinpirole reduced them. These results suggest that regulation of kalirin-7 through D2R in the NAc is a general pathway in rats and mice, and is involved in CUS-induced depression-like behaviors. Kalirin-7 may be directly regulated through the D2R postsynaptic pathway or indirectly through the presynaptic pathway in the NAc. The interaction between D2R and kalirin-7 needs to be investigated further.

As it appears to improve mood, we examined its actions in rodent models of antidepressant properties, in comparison with the prototypical anti-Parkinson agent, apomorphine, the D2/D3 receptor agonist, quinpirole, and the antidepressants, imipramine and fluvoxamine. In the mouse forced-swim test, acute administration of imipramine, fluvoxamine, apomorphine or quinpirole decreased immobility time, actions dose dependently mimicked by piribedil (2.5-10.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously). In rats, acute and subchronic administration of piribedil similarly reduced immobility (0.63-10.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) and apomorphine, quinpirole and imipramine were also active in this test, whereas fluvoxamine was inactive. Both in mice and in rats, the D2/D3 receptor antagonist, raclopride, and the D2 receptor antagonist, L741,626, dose dependently blocked the antidepressant properties of piribedil, whereas the selective D3 receptor antagonists, S33084 and SB277,011, were ineffective. In a chronic mild stress model in rats, piribedil (2.5-40.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) restored sucrose intake in stressed animals exerting its actions more rapidly (by week 1) than imipramine. Imipramine, fluvoxamine, apomorphine, quinpirole and piribedil dose dependently (0.63-10.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) suppressed aggressive and marble-burying behaviour in mice.

Forty male wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups. First group was used as control although second group was depression-induced group. Aripiprazole, lamotrigine and escitalopram per day were orally supplemented to chronic mild stress (CMS) depression-induced rats constituting the third, fourth and fifth groups for 28 days, respectively. Depression resulted in significant decrease in the glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, reduced glutathione and vitamin C of cortex of the brain although their levels and beta-carotene concentrations were increased by the three drugs administrations to the animals of CMS induced depression group.

OBJECTIVE: The present studies assessed potential sex differences in rodent paradigms used to study different components of depressive-like behavior, and in the treatment response to antidepressants with different mechanisms of action. METHODS: Male and female CD1 mice received Tetrabenazine (TBZ), a VMAT-2 blocker that depletes DA and induces depressive symptoms in humans.

DA depletion did not affect other aspects of depression such as anxiety, sociability or sucrose consumption, and there was no interaction with bupropion on these parameters.

In addition, bupropion (a DA reuptake inhibitor) or fluoxetine (a serotonin reuptake inhibitor) were used to reverse TBZ-induced anergia. RESULTS: In the FST, bupropion reversed TBZ effects in both sexes but fluoxetine was only effective in female mice. DA depletion did not affect other aspects of depression such as anxiety, sociability or sucrose consumption, and there was no interaction with bupropion on these parameters. In TBZ treated-females SERT-blockers may be effective at reversing anergia in aversive contexts (FST), and potentiating avoidance of anxiogenic stimuli.

Chronic mild stress (CMS)-induced decreases in sucrose consumption were reversed by 3-4 twice-weekly injections of quinpirole (QN) or bromocriptine.

It is well accepted that emotional stress in early life, such as maternal separation (MS), leads to alterations in the neurotransmission systems of various brain regions, especially the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, and subsequently can increase the risk for development of psychiatric disorders including depression in adulthood. Selegiline is an irreversible monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B inhibitor which increases striatal dopamine levels and exerts an antidepressant effect. In this study, 180min of MS stress was applied to mice at postnatal day (PND) 2-14 followed by behavioral tests for determining depressive-like behaviors, such as forced swimming test (FST), splash test and sucrose preference test (SPT) in adult mice (PND 50). The open field test (OFT) also was applied to validate FST results. We used SCH23390 (D1 antagonist) and sulpiride (D2 antagonist) in order to determine the role of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in antidepressant-like effects of selegiline. Our results revealed that MS provoked depressive-like behaviors in adult male mice, and the administration of selegiline attenuated depressive-like behaviors in MS mice. Our findings showed that D1 dopamine receptors facilitate the positive effects of selegiline on the passive behavior in the FST. Furthermore, antidepressant effects of selegiline on hedonic difficulties are mediated via D2 receptor in the SPT.

Previous reports showed that SKF83959 elicited antidepressant activity in the forced swim test and tail suspension test as a novel triple reuptake inhibitor. However, there are no studies showing the effects of SKF83959 in a chronic stress model of depression and the role of phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±/brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway in SKF83959-mediated antidepressant effects. METHODS: In this study, SKF83959 was firstly investigated in the chronic social defeat stress model of depression. The changes in hippocampal neurogenesis, dendrite spine density, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway after chronic social defeat stress and SKF83959 treatment were then investigated. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA/short hairpin RNA methods were further used to explore the antidepressive mechanisms of SKF83959. RESULTS: We found that SKF83959 produced antidepressant effects in the chronic social defeat stress model and also restored the chronic social defeat stress-induced decrease in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway, dendritic spine density, and neurogenesis. By using various inhibitors and siRNA/shRNA methods, we further demonstrated that the hippocampal dopamine D5 receptor, phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/ calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ± pathway, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor system are all necessary for the SKF83959 effects. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SKF83959 can be developed as a novel antidepressant and produces antidepressant effects via the hippocampal D5/ phospholipase C/inositol phosphate

Previous reports showed that SKF83959 elicited antidepressant activity in the forced swim test and tail suspension test as a novel triple reuptake inhibitor. However, there are no studies showing the effects of SKF83959 in a chronic stress model of depression and the role of phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±/brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway in SKF83959-mediated antidepressant effects. METHODS: In this study, SKF83959 was firstly investigated in the chronic social defeat stress model of depression. The changes in hippocampal neurogenesis, dendrite spine density, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway after chronic social defeat stress and SKF83959 treatment were then investigated. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA/short hairpin RNA methods were further used to explore the antidepressive mechanisms of SKF83959. RESULTS: We found that SKF83959 produced antidepressant effects in the chronic social defeat stress model and also restored the chronic social defeat stress-induced decrease in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway, dendritic spine density, and neurogenesis. By using various inhibitors and siRNA/shRNA methods, we further demonstrated that the hippocampal dopamine D5 receptor, phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/ calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ± pathway, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor system are all necessary for the SKF83959 effects. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SKF83959 can be developed as a novel antidepressant and produces antidepressant effects via the hippocampal D5/ phospholipase C/inositol phosphate

Previous reports showed that SKF83959 elicited antidepressant activity in the forced swim test and tail suspension test as a novel triple reuptake inhibitor. However, there are no studies showing the effects of SKF83959 in a chronic stress model of depression and the role of phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±/brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway in SKF83959-mediated antidepressant effects. METHODS: In this study, SKF83959 was firstly investigated in the chronic social defeat stress model of depression. The changes in hippocampal neurogenesis, dendrite spine density, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway after chronic social defeat stress and SKF83959 treatment were then investigated. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA/short hairpin RNA methods were further used to explore the antidepressive mechanisms of SKF83959. RESULTS: We found that SKF83959 produced antidepressant effects in the chronic social defeat stress model and also restored the chronic social defeat stress-induced decrease in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway, dendritic spine density, and neurogenesis. By using various inhibitors and siRNA/shRNA methods, we further demonstrated that the hippocampal dopamine D5 receptor, phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/ calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ± pathway, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor system are all necessary for the SKF83959 effects.

Previous reports showed that SKF83959 elicited antidepressant activity in the forced swim test and tail suspension test as a novel triple reuptake inhibitor. However, there are no studies showing the effects of SKF83959 in a chronic stress model of depression and the role of phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±/brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway in SKF83959-mediated antidepressant effects. METHODS: In this study, SKF83959 was firstly investigated in the chronic social defeat stress model of depression. The changes in hippocampal neurogenesis, dendrite spine density, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway after chronic social defeat stress and SKF83959 treatment were then investigated. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA/short hairpin RNA methods were further used to explore the antidepressive mechanisms of SKF83959. RESULTS: We found that SKF83959 produced antidepressant effects in the chronic social defeat stress model and also restored the chronic social defeat stress-induced decrease in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway, dendritic spine density, and neurogenesis. By using various inhibitors and siRNA/shRNA methods, we further demonstrated that the hippocampal dopamine D5 receptor, phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/ calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ± pathway, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor system are all necessary for the SKF83959 effects.

Previous reports showed that SKF83959 elicited antidepressant activity in the forced swim test and tail suspension test as a novel triple reuptake inhibitor. However, there are no studies showing the effects of SKF83959 in a chronic stress model of depression and the role of phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ±/brain-derived neurotrophic factor pathway in SKF83959-mediated antidepressant effects. METHODS: In this study, SKF83959 was firstly investigated in the chronic social defeat stress model of depression. The changes in hippocampal neurogenesis, dendrite spine density, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway after chronic social defeat stress and SKF83959 treatment were then investigated. Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNA/short hairpin RNA methods were further used to explore the antidepressive mechanisms of SKF83959. RESULTS: We found that SKF83959 produced antidepressant effects in the chronic social defeat stress model and also restored the chronic social defeat stress-induced decrease in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling pathway, dendritic spine density, and neurogenesis. By using various inhibitors and siRNA/shRNA methods, we further demonstrated that the hippocampal dopamine D5 receptor, phospholipase C/inositol phosphate 3/ calmodulin-dependent kinase IIÎ± pathway, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor system are all necessary for the SKF83959 effects.
